<h1>The Best Footballers </h1>
<h2>Top 3 best Footballers of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>LIONEL MESSI</h3>
<p>7 Ballon d'ors and 6 golden boots speak volumes about how great he is at winning. He also has won every single competition he has ever played in. Until now, as he just moved to a new league in the states. but we all know he will win trophis over there too</p>
<h3>CRISTIANO RONALDO</h3>
<p>Its actually a no-brainer. You can't list the top footballers and not put his name on it. The international all-time leading top scorer with more than 840 goals is an absolute beast and also without a doubt the biggest rival of Lionel messi</p>
<h3>KEVIN DEBRUYNE</h3>
<p>KDB's brilliance on the football pitch is truly unmatched. His precise passes, strategic vision and impeccable decision-making make him a maestro in midfield. With the ability to ochestrate game-changing moments and create opportunities out of thin air, he embodies the essenceof a modern football genius. In my opinion, he is the best footballer on the planet!</p>
